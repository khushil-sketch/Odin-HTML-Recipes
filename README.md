# odin-recipes
Building a Recipe Website (culmination of The Odin Project HTML foundations).
The webpage has a basic landing page which then leads the user to 2 delicious recipes. 
There is a back button that I included in both recipe pages (via the anchor tags) to let the user go back to the main recipe page.
